# Venombase
Venombase is a venomous snake identification database that allows you to accurately identify different snakes by color and state. It uses SQL server as a front end and SSRS as a front end. I connected the two with stored procedures. I got my data from different state wildlife websites and converted it into tables within my database. There is also a feature in which you can add recent reptiles you have spotted and where you saw them. Then, you can look at the community board and see the reptiles other people have spotted and where. There is also a report that serves as kind of an about page and also shows data on why you shouldn't be scared of snakes.

Here is a video of Venombase in Action!
